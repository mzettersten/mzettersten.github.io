<strong>I am an <a href="https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/martin-zettersten.html" target="_blank">Assistant Professor</a> in the <a href="https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Cognitive Science</a> at the University of California, San Diego.</strong> I run the <a href="https://lillab.ucsd.edu/" target="_blank">Language and Infant Learning (LIL) Lab</a>. Please feel free to reach out if you are curious about my work and joining my lab.

Before coming to UCSD, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the <a href="https://psych.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Psychology</a> at Princeton University, working in the  <a href="https://babylab.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Princeton Baby Lab</a>. I completed my PhD in Cognitive/ Developmental Psychology in the  <a href="https://infantlearning.waisman.wisc.edu/" target="_blank">Infant Learning Lab</a> at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working with Jenny Saffran and Gary Lupyan.

<strong>I study language - how we learn it and what we do with it.</strong>

I also work on building team science projects that help address key questions in infant development. Some recent work includes <a href="https://peekbank.stanford.edu" target="_blank">Peekbank</a>, an open database of infant eye-tracking data, and <a href="https://manybabies.github.io/MB5/" target="_blank">ManyBabies</a>, cross-lab collaborations testing key empirical questions in infant cognition.
