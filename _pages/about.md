<strong>I am an [Assistant Professor](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/martin-zettersten.html){:target="\_blank"} in the [Department of Cognitive Science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the University of California, San Diego.</strong> I run the [Language and Infant Learning (LIL) Lab](https://lillab.ucsd.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. Please feel free to reach out if you are curious about my work and joining my lab.

Before coming to UCSD, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in the [Department of Psychology](https://psych.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at Princeton University, working in the [Princeton Baby Lab](https://babylab.princeton.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. I completed my PhD in Cognitive/ Developmental Psychology in the [Infant Learning Lab](https://infantlearning.waisman.wisc.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, working with Jenny Saffran and Gary Lupyan.

<strong>I study language - how we learn it and what we do with it.</strong>

<!--I also work on building team science projects that help address key questions in infant development. Some recent work includes [Peekbank](https://peekbank.stanford.edu){:target="\_blank"}, an open database of infant eye-tracking data, and [ManyBabies](https://manybabies.github.io/MB5/){:target="\_blank"}, cross-lab collaborations testing key empirical questions in infant cognition. -->
